# Electronics for Mechanical Engineers

_Electronics for Mechanical Engineers_ is a class developed by Brandon Stafford, first taught in the spring of 2018 at Tufts University, now returning for a second year.

The point of the class is to provide you with hands-on experience building and debugging electronics, to complement the theory that you learn in other classes. To that end, the class is based around a series of projects, which range from designing a basic regulated power supply to building a high-current motor driver run by a microcontroller. The final project is one of your own design.

## Basic information

*   The [syllabus](syllabus.html) for the class
*   [Project requirements](projects.html)
*   [Components](components.html) we use in the class, just for reference.
*   Learning to [design printed circuit boards](pcbs.html)
*   About [transistors](transistors.html)
*   About [motors and mosfets](MotorsandMosfets.html)
*   Programming [Arduinos](arduino-programming.html)
*   Setting up a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](rpi-setup.html)

## Other stuff you might want to read or watch

*   Micah Elizabeth Scott figures out how to [extract the code out of a tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeCQatNcF20) by making a device (the ["Facewhisperer"](https://github.com/scanlime/facewhisperer)) that can interrupt the power supply to the tablet for a certain number of milliseconds, so that the tablet accidentally spews out all of its code when the USB port gets initialized. Her tenacity is amazing.
*   [_Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule_](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), an essay by Paul Graham about how to work efficiently as a maker
*   [Wired's description of the discovery of Stuxnet](https://www.wired.com/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/), probably the world's first state-sponsored cyberweapon

> "The fact that Stuxnet was injecting commands into the PLC and masking that it was doing so was evidence that it was designed, not for espionage as everyone had believed, but for physical sabotage. The researchers were stunned. It was the first time anyone had seen digital code in the wild being used to physically destroy something in the real world.

> "The malware would sit quietly on the system doing reconnaissance for about two weeks, then launch its attack swiftly and quietly, increasing the frequency of the converters to 1,410Hz for 15 minutes, before restoring them to a normal frequency of 1,064Hz. The frequency would remain at this level for 27 days, before Stuxnet would kick in again and drop the frequency down to 2Hz for 50 minutes."
